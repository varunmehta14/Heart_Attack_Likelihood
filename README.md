## Name: Varun Mehta

## **1\. Introduction**

The models explored include:

1. **Logistic Regression** (Baseline Model)  
2. **Deep Neural Network (DNN) with batch size \= 16**  
3. **Deep Neural Network (DNN) with batch size \= 8**  
4. **Ensemble of Feedforward Network (FFN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with batch size \= 8**  
5. **Ensemble of FFN and CNN with batch size \= 16**  
6. **Ensemble of FFN and CNN (Expanded Architecture) with batch size \= 32**

Each model’s performance is assessed based on accuracy, recall, and AUC-ROC scores. Additionally, this report discusses data preprocessing strategies, training behavior, and the rationale behind each methodological choice.

## **2\. Data Preprocessing**

### **2.1 Data Cleaning**

* **Blood Pressure Feature Engineering:** The dataset originally contained a single column for blood pressure recorded as systolic/diastolic. This was decomposed into two independent variables to enhance interpretability and facilitate differential analysis of systolic and diastolic pressure effects.

  * **Rationale:** Given that systolic and diastolic blood pressures are physiologically distinct and indicative of separate cardiovascular risk factors, isolating them allows the model to infer their independent contributions.  
* **Categorical Variable Encoding:**

  * **Binary Features:** Label encoding was applied to binary categorical variables such as gender and urban/rural classification.  
  * **Multiclass Features:** One-hot encoding was employed for variables with multiple categories (e.g., regional classification, stress level) to mitigate the risk of misleading ordinal assumptions.  
  * **Rationale:** Label encoding preserves a natural binary distinction, while one-hot encoding prevents the model from incorrectly assuming hierarchical relationships among categorical values.

### **2.2 Missing Value Imputation**

* Missing values were imputed using domain-specific heuristics:  
  * **Numerical Features:** Mean imputation was applied where data was missing at random.  
  * **Categorical Features:** Mode imputation was utilized for categorical data to maintain categorical integrity without introducing spurious variance.  
  * **Rationale:** Imputation prevents the loss of valuable training instances while maintaining statistical consistency within feature distributions (Little & Rubin, 2002).

### **2.3 Addressing Class Imbalance**

* **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** was implemented to counteract class imbalance by synthesizing new instances of the minority class.  
  * **Rationale:** Unbalanced classes can lead to biased learning where the model disproportionately favors the majority class. SMOTE ensures equitable learning across both classes (Chawla et al., 2002).

### **2.4 Feature Scaling**

* Both StandardScaler and RobustScaler were evaluated.  
* **RobustScaler** was applied to standardize numerical features, including age, cholesterol, BMI, and heart rate.  
  * **Rationale:**  
    * RobustScaler is resilient to outliers, unlike traditional normalization methods.  
    * Standardized feature magnitudes expedite convergence in gradient-based optimization.  
    * Prevents dominance of features with larger numerical ranges.

## **3\. Model Architectures**

### **3.1 Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)**

* A simple linear model used for binary classification.  
* **Accuracy: 87.37%**  
* **Limitations:** Lacks the ability to model complex, non-linear relationships.

### **3.2 Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**

* Implemented as a **4-layer fully connected network** with:  
  * **ReLU activation** for hidden layers  
  * **Sigmoid activation** for binary classification  
  * **Batch Normalization** for stabilizing training  
  * **Dropout layers** to mitigate overfitting

**Model Variants:**

* **DNN (Batch size \= 16\)** → Balanced generalization and efficiency (**Accuracy: 87.25%**)  
* **DNN (Glorot Uniform Initialization, Batch size \= 8\)** → Smoother weight initialization, improved convergence (**Accuracy: 87.35%**)  
* **DNN (He Normal Initialization, Batch size \= 8\)** → Stable convergence and better learning dynamics (**Accuracy: 87.38%**)

### **3.3 Ensembles of FFN and CNN**

* FFNs capture global feature interactions, while CNNs identify local patterns within structured medical data.

**Tested Variants:**

* **Ensemble (Batch Size \= 8\)** → Accuracy: **87.38%**  
* **Ensemble (Batch Size \= 16\)** → Accuracy: **87.38%**  
* **Wider Ensemble (Batch Size \= 32\)** → Best generalization with **87.44% Accuracy**

## **4\. Justification for Neural Network Selection**

* **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)** were selected due to their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships in medical data, capturing subtle interactions between features that traditional models like logistic regression fail to recognize.  
* **Batch Normalization** was included to stabilize learning by reducing internal covariate shift, leading to improved convergence speed.  
* **Dropout layers** were integrated to prevent overfitting, particularly critical in medical datasets where data scarcity is common.  
* **ReLU activation** was preferred for hidden layers due to its non-linearity and computational efficiency, promoting sparse activation and reducing vanishing gradient issues.  
* **He Normal and Glorot Uniform Initializations** were used to ensure better weight initialization, aiding in stable and efficient model convergence.  
* **CNN-based ensemble models** were chosen for their ability to extract spatial and local patterns, enhancing predictive performance through feature augmentation.

## **5\. Model Training & Performance Analysis**

### **5.1 Training Curve Analysis**

* **Early Epochs:** A steep decline in loss indicates effective feature learning.  
* **Plateau Phase (\~10 epochs):** Models stabilized, suggesting diminishing returns with additional training.  
* **Validation Loss Drop:** Learning rate adjustments improved model convergence.  
* **Overfitting Risks:** Smaller batch sizes (8) introduced variability but improved generalization, whereas batch size 32 exhibited signs of overfitting.

### **5.3 Observations**

* **Ensemble models performed best** by leveraging FFN’s high-level abstractions and CNN’s pattern recognition capabilities.  
* **Batch size 32 showed slight overfitting**, though it achieved the highest validation accuracy.  
* **DNNs with He Normal Initialization** exhibited the most stable convergence among neural network models.

## **6\. Conclusion**

* **Logistic Regression, though interpretable, is not optimal** for capturing complex feature interactions.  
* **Deep Neural Networks significantly enhance predictive power** by modeling intricate relationships.  
* **Ensemble models (FFN+CNN) provide the highest accuracy (87.44%)**, benefiting from complementary feature extraction techniques.  
* **Careful selection of batch size and weight initialization is critical** for optimizing model performance.

## **7\. Recommendations**

* **For interpretability:** Logistic Regression is preferable.  
* **For best predictive accuracy:** FFN+CNN ensemble with batch size 32\.  
* **For balanced performance and training efficiency:** DNN with batch size 16\.
